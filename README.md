# Dissipative-Particle-Dynamics-DPD-Simulation-of-Fluid-Polymer-Systems
Built a MATLAB-based DPD model to simulate fluids and polymer chains/rings using conservative, dissipative, and random forces.  Analyzed particle organization, temperature control, and momentum evolution under wall-driven and externally forced conditions.
